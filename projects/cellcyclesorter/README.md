# CellCycleSorter

CellCycleSorter is a simple command-line tool for organizing and categorizing cell cycle data (specifically, percentage of cells in each phase: G1, S, G2/M).

## Usage

Run `python main.py` and follow the prompts to input cell cycle data. The program will calculate a simple 'cycle score' and categorize the cell cycle state.

## Example

```
python main.py
Enter the percentage of cells in G1 phase: 60
Enter the percentage of cells in S phase: 20
Enter the percentage of cells in G2/M phase: 20

Cell Cycle Score: 0.20
Cell Cycle State: Balanced
```
