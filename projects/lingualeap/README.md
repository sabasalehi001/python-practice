# LinguaLeap: A Flashcard Quiz for Language Learning

LinguaLeap is a simple command-line application designed to help you learn vocabulary in a new language. It presents you with flashcards and tracks your progress.

## How to Use

1.  Run the program: `python main.py`
2.  Follow the prompts to add flashcards or start a quiz.
3.  During the quiz, enter your answer and press Enter to see if you're correct.

## Example Flashcard Data

While the program handles the data internally, here's an example of how flashcards could be structured:

```
{
  "hello": "Hola",
  "goodbye": "Adiós",
  "thank you": "Gracias"
}
```

## Future Enhancements

*   Implement saving/loading flashcards to/from a file.
*   Add different quiz modes (e.g., multiple choice).
*   Track user progress and provide statistics.
