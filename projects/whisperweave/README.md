# WhisperWeave

WhisperWeave is a simple command-line tool for basic text encryption and decryption using a Caesar cipher with a customizable key.

## Usage

Run `python main.py` to start the program. You can then choose to encrypt or decrypt text and provide a key.

## Example

python main.py
```

## Limitations

This is a very basic encryption method and is not suitable for securing sensitive information. It's intended for educational purposes and simple text obfuscation.
