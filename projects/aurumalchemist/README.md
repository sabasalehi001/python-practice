# AurumAlchemist

A simple command-line tool for exploring theoretical currency exchange scenarios. It allows you to input an amount, a starting currency, and a target currency, and then see the converted amount based on a pre-defined exchange rate.  No real-world data is used; the exchange rates are purely illustrative.

## Usage

Run `python main.py` and follow the on-screen prompts to enter the amount, starting currency, and target currency. The program will then calculate and display the converted amount, given a sample exchange rate.

## Example

```
python main.py
```

(Follow prompts in terminal)
