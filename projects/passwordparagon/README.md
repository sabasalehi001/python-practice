# PasswordParagon: A Basic Password Strength Checker

PasswordParagon is a simple command-line tool written in Python that analyzes the strength of a given password based on length, character variety, and common patterns.

## Usage

Run the script from your terminal:

```bash
python main.py
```

The program will prompt you to enter a password. After you enter your password, it will be analyzed, and a strength rating (Weak, Moderate, Strong, Excellent) will be displayed along with some feedback.

## Details

-   Checks password length.
-   Checks for a mix of uppercase, lowercase, digits, and symbols.
-   Provides a general strength rating.

## Limitations

This is a basic password strength checker and does not employ sophisticated techniques like dictionary attacks or entropy calculations. It's intended for educational purposes and to provide a general idea of password strength.
