# LexiLantern

LexiLantern is a simple command-line flashcard quiz program designed to help users learn vocabulary. It presents definitions and asks the user to guess the corresponding word. The program provides feedback and keeps track of the user's score.

## Usage

Run the `main.py` script using `python main.py`.

The program will load flashcards from a hardcoded dictionary. You can modify the dictionary within the `main.py` file to add or remove flashcards.

Follow the on-screen prompts to answer the quiz questions. The program will tell you if you are correct or incorrect, and provide the correct answer if you are wrong. At the end of the quiz, your score will be displayed.
