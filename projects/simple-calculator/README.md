# Simple Calculator

A basic command-line calculator program written in Python.

## Usage

Run the `main.py` script from your terminal:

```bash
python main.py
```

The program will prompt you to enter two numbers and an operation (+, -, *, /). It will then calculate and display the result.

## Example

```
Enter the first number: 10
Enter the second number: 5
Enter the operation (+, -, *, /): +
Result: 15.0
```

## Input Validation

The program includes basic input validation to handle invalid number formats and unsupported operations.
