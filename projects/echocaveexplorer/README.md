# EchoCaveExplorer

A simple ASCII game where you navigate a cave using sound (echoes).

## How to Play

Run `python main.py`.

You are in a cave. You can move North (N), South (S), East (E), or West (W).
Type a direction and press Enter to move.  The game tells you how far you traveled, if you hit a wall, or if you found the exit.

Find the exit to win!

## Example

```
You are in a cave.
What direction do you want to go? (N/S/E/W): N
You moved North 2 units.
What direction do you want to go? (N/S/E/W): E
You hit a wall!
What direction do you want to go? (N/S/E/W): S
You moved South 1 units.
What direction do you want to go? (N/S/E/W): W
You found the exit!
You win!
