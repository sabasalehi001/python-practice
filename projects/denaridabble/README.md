A simple command-line tool for exploring currency exchange scenarios.  It allows you to input an amount, a source currency, and a target currency, then displays the converted amount using pre-defined exchange rates. Think of it as a 'what if' currency converter, not a real-time financial tool.

## Usage

Run `python main.py` and follow the prompts.

## Example

```
$ python main.py
Enter amount: 100
Enter source currency (USD, EUR, GBP): USD
Enter target currency (USD, EUR, GBP): EUR
100 USD is equal to 93.0 EUR
```
