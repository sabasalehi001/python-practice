# TempoTapestry

A simple CLI-based interval timer that allows users to define a sequence of work and rest intervals.

## Usage

Run `python main.py` and follow the prompts to define the number of intervals, work duration, and rest duration. The timer will then guide you through each interval, displaying the remaining time for work and rest periods.

## Example

```
Number of intervals: 3
Work duration (seconds): 25
Rest duration (seconds): 5

Starting timer...

Work interval 1/3: 25 seconds remaining
...
Rest interval 1/3: 5 seconds remaining
...
Work interval 2/3: 25 seconds remaining
...
Rest interval 2/3: 5 seconds remaining
...
Work interval 3/3: 25 seconds remaining
...
Rest interval 3/3: 5 seconds remaining

Timer complete!
```
